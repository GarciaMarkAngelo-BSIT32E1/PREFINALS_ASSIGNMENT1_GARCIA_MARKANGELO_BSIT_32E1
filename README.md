Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?

- Yes,
 // I have heard of it and understand its purpose but I don't know how to actually implement it through programming.
 
 
 
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
 
- Yes,
 // but I don't know how to program it due to the lack of prerequisite knowledge on the language used.
 
Web API: (Yes/No) 
 
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
 
 -No

Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture:
 
 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
 1. Codependent
 2. Uniform
 3. Organized
 
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)

 - Dividing the functions through different layers allows the architecture to have a systematic and methodical approach to providing outputs.
 - Isolation of modules allows for a more comprehensive way of detecting issues and weaknesses within the infrastructure, by doing so you can isolate the problem without affecting the other layers' individual roles.


Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
 
 - Yes. I didn't have any idea what I was programming due to the lack of information so what ended up happening was I simply searched up different tutorials on how to do each function which overlapped with the other things that I was trying to do, in the end it became an amalgamation of different techniques I saw stitched together.

MVC:
 
 
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
 
Model, View, Controller
 
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
 
 Model: It manages the data, logic, and rules of the application's domain.
 View: Is responsible for presenting the data to the user.
 Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
 

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
 
 Yes, the main issue I have the enough understanding of the structure to be able to connect them.
 

Web API:
 
 
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
 
- I don't know the main difference because I don't know what a tradional MVC application looks like and how it operates. However, from what I understand Web API have a blackbox system in which a user requests an output they want to receive and the API provides them the order.
 
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
 
 
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)

- The only challenges I encountered was installing all the needed dependecies on the project. Same as the dependencies with the WEB API, I have no experience troubleshooting them but I tried to lower the version in order to make them compatible.
